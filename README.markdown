## Summarize - A Ruby C wrapper for Open Text Summarizer

## Installation

### Easy

    gem install summarize

### Manual

    git clone https://github.com/svenyurgensson/summarize.git
    cd summarize
    rake build
    gem build summarize.gemspec
    gem install summarize-1.0.4.gem

## Usage

The summarize method is added to File which you can use to summarize the contents of any plain text file

    File.open('path/to/file').summarize

Or use the String method

    "text to summarize".summarize

By default it uses an English dictionary for summarizing but forty languages are supported. Pass in the valid ISO 639 language code to use one. A ratio (default is 25%) can also be passed in.

    # Parse an article using Portuguese stemming rules with a ratio of 50%
    "texto para sumariar".summarize(:language => 'pt', :ratio => 50)

You can also use custom stemming rules

    "text to summarize".summarize(:dictionary => 'path/to/custom/dictionary')

Topics can also be returned

    # Returns an array with content first and topics second
    content, topics = "text to summarize".summarize(:topics => true)
    # content => summarized text
    # topics  => Comma-delimited string of topics

## Dependencies

You must have glib-2.0 and libxml-2.0 installed and properly configured.
